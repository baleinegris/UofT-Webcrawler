# UofT-Webcrawler
<p>This project aims to crawl UofT websites, and vector embed chunks of text using Qdrant. The project will have a web user interface and a REST API allowing users to search the database for relevant information. (eg: user searches "Bayesian Networks" and gets classes and programs related to Bayesian Networks)</p>
